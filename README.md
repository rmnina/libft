# Libft

LIBFT is the first project in the 42 curriculum. The aim here is to create a library of basic, useful functions in C, so that we can reuse them in future projects. The "bonus" part teaches how to manipulate and operate on linked lists.
Each function is written in its own file. The Makefile allows these files to be compiled into a static .a library. "make" will compile all mandatory functions and "make bonus" will compile all bonus functions.
